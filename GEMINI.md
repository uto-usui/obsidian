# Obsidian Vault: Memo and Story Writing

This Obsidian vault is used for writing memos and stories.

## Directory Structure

*   `memo/`: This directory is for storing memos.
*   `tales/`: This directory is for storing stories.
*   `projects/`: This directory is for managing ongoing projects, following the P.A.R.A. method.

## Memo-Writing Philosophy

Memos in this vault, especially those based on research, will be written following the Diataxis framework. This means organizing information into one of four categories:

*   **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides to accomplish a specific goal.
*   **How-to guides:** More advanced guides that explain how to solve a specific problem.
*   **Explanation:** Conceptual explanations that clarify a topic.
*   **Reference:** Technical descriptions of machinery and how to operate it.

When creating a memo, I will consider which of these categories is most appropriate for the content.

## How I will assist you

When you ask me to create a new note, I will ask you whether it is a "memo" or a "story" and save it in the appropriate directory. If you do not specify, I will ask for clarification.
